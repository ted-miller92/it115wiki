Introduction and History

Ruby on Rails (RoR or Rails) is yet another solution stack to consider while deciding how to complete a project. The brainchild of Danish programmer David Heinemeier Hansson who released the framework in 2004, Hansson has stated that the purpose of Rails was to produce a solution that allows for “beautiful code” to exist and to satisfy the programmer by allowing them an environment with complete happiness. Through his time spent working with Basecamp, a project management tool (at the company of the same name) he based his solution upon two simple philosophies: “Convention over Configuration” (CoC) and “Don’t Repeat Yourself” (DRY). These concepts essentially mean that a developer won’t have to write each component of code separately and reduces repeated software patterns, respectively. Thus, working more efficiently.

While considerably more recent than the previous solution stacks explored, RoR has quickly risen to become quite the powerhouse in the software game. Upon its immediate release, Rails gained notoriety as it became widely popular among many in the startup community. And, as one of the most used open source web frameworks, big name applications in tech such as Hulu, Twitch, Airbnb, Twitter and Github were built using Ruby on Rails.
